				<p class="text-faded" align="justify" style="text-indent: 50px;">I have been developing websites since 2016, although most of them are not showcased here because most of them are proprietary projects. I am mostly strong background in backend programming but I am starting to lean and learn on how to develop a beautiful frontend. Even though it seems that I am mainly a web developer, I am also a software developer that have a strong background knowledge in Java and C#.</p>
